/// Compiled-in mainnet seeds: `(asset_id, symbol, decimals)`.
///
/// Each entry MUST be verified against the token contract's `ft_metadata`
/// before being added; a wrong `decimals` silently misrenders amounts, so
/// anything not confidently verified is omitted and falls back to the raw
/// asset id. `wrap.near` is the canonical wrapped-NEAR contract (24 decimals,
/// matching native NEAR).
///
/// # Symbols are origin-qualified, and unique
///
/// The on-chain `ft_metadata` symbol is not usable verbatim. Four distinct
/// assets report `{"symbol":"ETH","decimals":18}` -- Ethereum's ether via the
/// omni bridge and via the legacy rainbow bridge, plus ether bridged from Base
/// and from Arbitrum -- and four report `{"symbol":"USDC","decimals":6}`.
/// `SignablePayloadFieldAmountV2` carries only an amount and an abbreviation,
/// so seeding the raw symbol would render Base ether identically to mainnet
/// ether, and a swap of one for the other identically to its mirror.
///
/// So the bare symbol belongs to the asset native to its own chain, and
/// anything bridged from elsewhere carries an origin suffix (`ETH.base`,
/// `USDC.sol`). `.e` marks the legacy rainbow-bridge entries, the convention
/// the first stablecoin seeds already used. `every_seeded_symbol_is_unique`
/// enforces this: a new entry that collides fails the test rather than
/// silently making two assets look alike.
///
/// # Sourcing
///
/// `scripts/gen_near_token_seeds.sh` resolves ids through `omni.bridge.near`'s
/// own registry, rather than hand-typing the `<chain>-<address>.omft.near`
/// convention. Its output is a starting point, not the authority. Both of its
/// lookups answer with ids that real intents do not carry:
/// `get_native_token_id` gives `Eth` the legacy `eth.bridge.near` and
/// `Base`/`Arb`/`Pol` their `.omdep.near` deposit contracts, and
/// `get_token_id` gives Ethereum USDC/USDT their legacy `factory.bridge.near`
/// ids while returning nothing at all for Base or Arbitrum.
///
/// So every entry's `symbol`/`decimals` is confirmed against the token
/// contract's own `ft_metadata`, and its id rests on one of these:
///
/// - **observed traffic** -- `eth.omft.near` and `sol.omft.near` appear in
///   captured production envelopes, which is also what establishes
///   `<chain>.omft.near` as the intents-facing form for the entries beside
///   them;
/// - **the bridge registry** -- `get_token_id` maps the canonical Solana USDC
///   and USDT mints onto the two `sol-*` ids, and `get_native_token_id` names
///   `nbtc.bridge.near` for `Btc`;
/// - **a self-describing id** -- the two `eth-0x...` ids embed the source-chain
///   contract address, so it can be checked against Ethereum directly.
///
/// Assets whose id has none of these -- notably the per-token Base and
/// Arbitrum stablecoins, which the bridge does not index at all -- are left
/// out. They render as raw base units against their asset id, which is honest
/// about what the parser knows.
