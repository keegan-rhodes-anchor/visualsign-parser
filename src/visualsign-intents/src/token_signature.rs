//! NEAR Intents token-metadata extraction and signature validation.
//!
//! Mirrors `visualsign-ethereum::abi_metadata` and
//! `visualsign-solana::idl::signature`: converts `ChainMetadata.near.token_mappings`
//! into a [`NearTokenRegistry`] override layer, optionally validating a signature
//! attached to each entry. Like `Abi.value`/`Idl.value`, `TokenMetadataEntry.value`
//! is signed verbatim as supplied -- the signature covers exactly those bytes,
//! not a re-derived encoding, so there is no field-order/escaping contract for
//! an external signer to get right.
//!
//! # Trust model: dispatch by asset origin, not by NEAR itself
//!
//! Every asset id renders as a NEAR-side identity (`nep141:...`), but the
//! underlying value may live on NEAR itself or have been bridged in from another
//! chain. Rather than a single NEAR-wide curator key, the signature curve is
//! chosen per entry by [`TokenOriginChain`]: `Ethereum` (and every EVM twin the
//! omni-bridge lists: Arbitrum, Base, BNB, Polygon, Abstract, HyperEVM) verifies
//! with secp256k1, reusing the same curve family as `visualsign-ethereum`'s ABI
//! curator identity; `Solana` (and its SVM twin, Fogo) verifies with ed25519,
//! matching `visualsign-solana`'s IDL curator identity; `Near` (and unset, which
//! defaults to it) verifies with ed25519 under a distinct, NEAR-only curator
//! identity. Chains the omni-bridge lists but this parser has no existing curve
//! support for (Bitcoin, Zcash, Starknet, Aptos) are not given bespoke curve
//! verification here; entries for such assets should omit `origin_chain` (or
//! leave it unset) and rely on the NEAR-native curator, or ship unsigned.
//!
//! Each origin is a [`TokenMetadataDomain`], which names one domain-separated
//! prehash and one set of curator keys. The two are the same value, so a
//! signature can only ever be checked against the keys enrolled for the domain
//! it was signed under.
//!
//! Curator keys live in a single [`SignerAllowlist`], with each entry bound to
//! its domain by [`scoped_signer_key`]. The same physical key enrolled for two
//! domains is two distinct entries, so revoking "trusted to vouch for
//! Ethereum-origin assets" does not silently also revoke (or, worse, leave
//! standing) "trusted to vouch for NEAR-native ones". The Ethereum ABI and
//! Solana IDL paths keep their own allowlists and are untouched by this.
//!
//! A signature that fails to verify is rejected outright: it means the bytes or
//! the key were altered. A signature that verifies under a key this deployment
//! has not enrolled is not tampering -- it is an assertion from a party the
//! parser cannot attribute, so it is worth what an unsigned entry is worth and
//! is treated identically. Either may still be accepted (not every caller signs
//! yet), but only when the deployment's [`MetadataTrustPolicy`] allows it and
//! the asset isn't already covered by the compiled-in `tokens::SEEDS` table --
//! unattributable metadata fills a gap, it never overrides a curated value.
